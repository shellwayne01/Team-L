## L Train Shutdown Proposal

### What's the Problem? 
The L Train is in need of repairs in the Canarsie Tunnels because of Hurrican Sandy in 2012. 
The shutdown will begin for 15 months from April 2019 to July 2020.
Every L Train station in Manhattan will be shutdown and the L Train will be active from Bedford to Canarsie. 

The graph below represents the annual train ridership of the affected stations. The ridership on the stops in Manhattan are very high compared to other stations, and will impact a large amount of people. With the impending L train shutdown, it will impact the nearby train lines such as the M and G lines.

### Possible Solutions 
The image bellow shows alternative transportation optons, such as increased train services, and ferry opportunities.

### Brooklyn: How do we get people from Brooklyn into Manhattan and vice versa?

We intend on extending the bus route of an existing bus line in Manhattan into Williamsburg, and increasing its frequency as well.

The graph below shows the current and proposed frequency of a populated stop in Manhattan from 6 am to 6 pm. We intend on increasing the bus frequency every hour by 5 buses.

The image below shows the current route of 14A.

Our proposed plan is to extend the 14A bus route, and removing several stops on Grand St. because of its access to other buses.
Blue Markers: Existing stop used for other bus routes.
Grey Markers: Current route.
Green Markers: Temporary stops to be added.
Red Markers: Section to be Removed.

### Manhattan: How do we speed up the transportation on 14th Street?
Private cars are the least efficient form of transportation. We are proposing to close 14th street to buses, bikes, and pedestrians.
