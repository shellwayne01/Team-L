# L Train Shutdown Proposal

## What's the Problem? 
The L Train is still in need of repairs in the Canarsie Tunnels because of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In the aftermath of the hurricane, the tunnels were flooded with seawater that damaged many electrical components and structures. Rehabilitation is needed to ensure continued service and prevent just as much damage from happening in the case of future storms. Thus, this shutdown is absolutely necessary and unpreventable. The effect this shutdown will have on commuters will be severe. Furthermore, the business and real estate scene in affected neighborhoods will also be bleak if a feasible solution is not proposed and enacted. Fortunately, we can alleviate the disruptions this shutdown will cause with the right plan.  

The shutdown will last for 15 months, from April 2019 to July 2020.
Every L Train station in Manhattan will be shutdown and the L Train will only be active from Bedford to Canarsie. 

The graph below represents the annual train ridership of the affected stations. The ridership on the stops in Manhattan are very high compared to other stations, and will impact a large amount of people. With the impending L train shutdown, it will impact the nearby train lines such as the M and G lines.

## Possible Solutions 
The image bellow shows alternative transportation optons, such as increased train services, and ferry opportunities.

### Brooklyn: How do we get people from Brooklyn into Manhattan and vice versa?

We intend on extending the bus route of an existing bus line in Manhattan into Williamsburg, and increasing its frequency as well.
The image below shows the current route of 14A.

Our proposed plan is to extend the 14A bus route, and removing several stops on Grand St. because of its access to other buses.
- Blue Markers: Existing stop used for other bus routes.
- Grey Markers: Current route.
- Green Markers: Temporary stops to be added.
- Red Markers: Section to be Removed.

The graph below shows the current and proposed frequency of a populated stop in Manhattan from 6 am to 6 pm. We intend on increasing the bus frequency every hour by 5 buses.

### Manhattan: How do we speed up the transportation on 14th Street?
Private cars are the least efficient form of transportation. We are proposing to close 14th street to buses, bikes, and pedestrians.
