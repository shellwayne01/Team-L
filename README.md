## L Train Shutdown Proposal

### What's the Problem? (Discuss Hurricane Sandy and L Train Shutdown)
The L Train is in need of repairs in the Canarsie Tunnels because of Hurrican Sandy in 2012. 
The shutdown will begin for 15 months from April 2019 to July 2020.
Every L Train station in Manhattan will be shutdown and the L Train will be active from Bedford to Canarsie.

### Brooklyn

### Manhattan
### The Problem: 
How to handle displaced L train commuters when the L train shuts down?

"In 2016, the MTA set forth two proposals on how to go about shutting down the L line for repairs. After considering an operational review and input from the community, the MTA decided to suspend service between Eighth Avenue in Manhattan and Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn for 18 months beginning January 2019 at the earliest. But in April 2017, the agency's board voted for the project to begin in April 2019 and last 15 months instead. During the shutdown, L train service will continue to operate in Brooklyn between Bedford Avenue and Rockaway Parkway…

Although the MTA has decided on a shutdown plan, the options in terms of alternatives for commuters are still up in the air. The MTA, however, has outlined several potential options, including shuttle service over the Williamsburg Bridge, increased service on the J, G, and M lines, and regular and Select Bus Service across town in Manhattan.”

### The Solution:
- Increase cross borough shuttle bus service from L Train - Bedford Ave. Station to L Train - 8th Ave. with bus stops along the normal L train route. Increase this service during peak hours.

- Shut down 14th street to all passenger vehicles - leaving it open only to commercial vehicles and taxis. 

- Extend 14A bus service across the Williamsburg bridge and up to Roebling and 8th street. 

- Increase train service
